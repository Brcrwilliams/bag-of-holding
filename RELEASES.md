# Bag of Holding Releases

## 1.0.0 - 03/18/2015

Getting this first release out the door has been a journey. Three months ago this application was just an idea and now... here it is. This project means a lot to me personally. For one to two years before writing this software, I had prototyped numerous similar softwares -- Matt Brown can attest to this. I feel this application takes the best of what I attempted to accomplish and puts it all into one *bag*.

Thank you everyone who inspired, provided feedback, and contributed to this project.
